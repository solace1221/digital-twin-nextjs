        "question": "Are you open to working abroad?",
        "question_tagalog": "Handa ka bang magtrabaho sa ibang bansa?",
        "answer": "Yes, I'm very open to working abroad! I'm eager to gain international experience in tech hubs like the US, Singapore, Japan, or anywhere with strong tech industries. I already have experience with international collaboration through my COIL project with Brazil, which showed me the value of cross-cultural teamwork. I'm willing to relocate within 30-60 days and would prefer to start with remote-first international roles initially or short-term contracts before committing to long-term relocation. I do need visa sponsorship for international positions, but I'm flexible and excited about the opportunity to grow my career globally while bringing my skills in web development and data analysis to international teams.",
        "answer_tagalog": "Oo, handa ako! Excited ako na magtrabaho sa ibang bansa para matuto at lumaki bilang tech professional. May experience na ako sa international collaboration through ng COIL project ko with Brazil, kaya alam ko kung paano makipagtulungan sa iba't ibang kultura. Kaya kong lumipat within 30-60 days at mas prefer ko initially yung remote-first roles o short-term contracts muna bago mag-commit sa long-term relocation. Need ko lang ng visa sponsorship, pero flexible naman ako at excited sa opportunity na magtrabaho globally habang ginagamit ang skills ko sa web development at data analysis.",

But honestly, I'm not picky - I'm more focused on the learning opportunities and growth potential rather than a specific location. My experience with international collaboration in my Brazil COIL project taught me that I can adapt to different cultures and work environments. What matters most to me is working with a team that values innovation, provides mentorship, and offers opportunities to develop my skills in web development and data analysis.",

However, I'm willing to work with the company on the visa process and can provide all necessary documentation promptly. I understand the visa sponsorship process may take time, so I'm flexible with timelines and can start with remote work while the paperwork is being processed. I'm also open to starting with short-term contracts or project-based work if that makes the visa process easier. My goal is to make the transition as smooth as possible for both myself and the employer.",
        "answer_tagalog": "Oo, kailangan ko ng visa sponsorship kasi Philippine citizen ako. Pero willing naman akong makipagtulungan sa company sa visa process at mabilis kong maibibigay ang lahat ng needed documents. Alam ko na ang visa process ay maaaring matagal, kaya flexible ako sa timeline at pwede akong mag-start ng remote work habang ina-process ang papers. Open din ako sa short-term contracts o project-based work kung mas madali yun para sa visa. Ang goal ko ay gawing smooth ang transition para sa akin at sa employer.",

        "answer": "Sure! In my capstone project, I faced a challenging problem with the decision support system logic. The system wasn't accurately processing student records for good moral certification - it was sometimes approving students who had violations. I spent days debugging the algorithm, analyzing the database queries, and testing different scenarios. I broke down the problem into smaller parts: first checking data input, then the decision rules, then the output logic. I discovered the issue was in how we were handling different violation types and their severity weights. I redesigned the algorithm, added better validation, and implemented comprehensive testing. The solution not only fixed the bug but made the system more robust. This taught me the importance of systematic debugging and thorough testing!",

        "question": "How do you handle stress and pressure?",
        "question_tagalog": "Paano mo hina-handle ang stress at pressure?",
        "answer": "I handle stress by staying organized and breaking large challenges into manageable tasks. When I'm under pressure - like during capstone project deadlines while leading two organizations - I prioritize ruthlessly and focus on what's most important. I use tools like Trello to visualize my workload and timelines. I'm not afraid to ask for help or delegate when needed. I also make sure to take short breaks to clear my mind - sometimes stepping away from a problem helps me see the solution. Physical activity and adequate sleep are important for maintaining performance under pressure. I've learned that stress often comes from feeling overwhelmed, so breaking things down and tackling them systematically helps me stay calm and productive.",

        "answer": "In the next 5 years, I aim to establish myself as a skilled Data Analyst or Software Engineer. Short-term, I want to graduate with honors in June 2026 and land my first professional role where I can apply my web development and data analysis skills. In years 2-3, I want to deepen my expertise in data analytics, master tools like Python for data science, SQL for complex queries, and data visualization platforms. I also want to earn relevant certifications in data analysis or cloud technologies. By year 4-5, I hope to be leading small projects or mentoring junior team members. I'm also open to specializing in AI/ML if opportunities arise. Ultimately, I want to become a go-to expert in data-driven decision making while continuing to grow technically and professionally!",

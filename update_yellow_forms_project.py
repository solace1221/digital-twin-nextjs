    I was the Project Leader of a {yellow_forms_project.get('team_size', '3-member')} team that developed a digital ticketing system 
    to modernize how Saint Paul University Philippines manages campus violations. We transformed the traditional 
    yellow paper forms (used for recording student violations) into a comprehensive digital solution.
    
    Technologies Used: {', '.join(yellow_forms_project.get('technologies', []))}
    Development Environment: {yellow_forms_project.get('development_environment', 'NetBeans IDE')}
    Course: {yellow_forms_project.get('course', 'Object Oriented Programming')}
    Grade Achieved: {yellow_forms_project.get('grade_achieved', '1.00 (Perfect Grade)')}
    
    Problem We Solved:
    {yellow_forms_project.get('problem_solved', 'Manual input of violator names was time-consuming and inefficient')}
    
    Key Features:
    {chr(10).join('- ' + feature for feature in yellow_forms_project.get('key_features', []))}
    
    My Role as Project Leader:
    - Led the team of 3 members across all development phases
    - Designed system architecture using OOP principles (encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism)
    - Developed core violation management modules in Java using NetBeans IDE
    - Implemented database integration for violator records and tracking
    - Coordinated team workflow and ensured timely deliverables
    - Applied lessons from achieving 1.00 (perfect grade) in OOP course
    
    Impact:
    {yellow_forms_project.get('impact', 'Modernized university violation tracking system')}
    
    Description:
    {yellow_forms_project.get('description', '')}
    
    This project represents my understanding of Object-Oriented Programming principles and my ability 
    to lead a team in delivering practical digital transformation solutions. The perfect grade I achieved 
    in OOP demonstrates my strong grasp of programming fundamentals.

## 💬 How to Talk About the AI Workshop

### If Asked "What did you learn in the AI workshop?":
> "The AI Data Analyst workshop gave me hands-on experience with AI-powered data analysis tools. I learned how AI can enhance traditional data analysis workflows - from automated data cleaning and pattern recognition to AI-assisted insights generation. It showed me how to leverage AI tools while maintaining the analytical thinking that's core to good data analysis. This experience reinforced that modern data analysts need to combine strong fundamentals with AI literacy."

### If Asked "What AI tools did you use?":
> "During the workshop, I worked with various AI-powered data analysis tools and learned how AI can automate repetitive tasks, identify patterns humans might miss, and generate initial insights faster. The key takeaway was that AI doesn't replace analytical thinking - it amplifies it. You still need to understand your data, ask the right questions, and validate AI-generated insights, but AI makes the process more efficient and can surface insights you might not have found manually."

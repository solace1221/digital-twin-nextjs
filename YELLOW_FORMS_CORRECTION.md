# ‚úÖ Yellow Forms OOP Project - Profile Correction Complete

## üéØ What Was Corrected

### ‚ùå **REMOVED: Fictional OOP Projects**
The following **FAKE** content has been completely removed from your profile:

1. **Banking System Project** (NEVER HAPPENED):
   - "BankAccount class with deposit/withdraw methods"
   - "Bank class managing all accounts"
   - Completely fabricated - you never did this

2. **University Student Information System** (NEVER HAPPENED):
   - "Student class with enroll/drop course methods"
   - "University class with course scheduling"
   - Completely fabricated - you never did this

**Why this was a problem:**
- These were 100% fictional projects that would be exposed in any technical interview
- Recruiters asking "tell me about your banking system project" would immediately catch the lie
- Damaged credibility and trust

# Follow-Up Question Generation System

## Overview

The follow-up question generation system enables Pearl's AI digital twin to maintain engaging, contextual conversations by automatically generating thoughtful, multi-paragraph follow-up questions based on user responses.

## Key Features

### ✅ **Contextual Follow-Ups**
- Analyzes user's response to generate relevant follow-up questions
- Maintains conversation flow and topic continuity
- Adapts to user's communication style and depth

### ✅ **Multi-Paragraph Questions**
- Generates 2-3 paragraph follow-up questions (not short sentences)
- Natural transitions between ideas
- Conversational prose (no bullet points or lists)

### ✅ **Smart Detection**
- Detects when user wants more information ("tell me more", "elaborate")
- Identifies vague or short responses that need elaboration prompts
- Recognizes conversation context from history

### ✅ **Interview Scenarios**
- Specialized follow-ups for: achievements, challenges, leadership, technical, career
- STAR methodology alignment for behavioral questions
- Professional yet personable tone

### ✅ **Bilingual Support**
- Works with both English and Tagalog/Filipino conversations
- Maintains language consistency throughout follow-ups

## Usage

### 1. Automatic Follow-Up Generation (Integrated with RAG)

```typescript
// In your API call to /api/rag-local
const response = await fetch('/api/rag-local', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    query: "What's your biggest achievement?",
    generateFollowUp: true,  // Enable automatic follow-up
    conversationHistory: [
      { role: 'assistant', content: 'Tell me about yourself' },
      { role: 'user', content: 'I am a BSIT student...' }
    ]
  })
});

const data = await response.json();
console.log(data.response);          // Pearl's answer
console.log(data.followUpQuestion);  // Generated follow-up question
```

### 2. Dedicated Follow-Up Endpoint

```typescript
// Generate follow-up based on user's response
const response = await fetch('/api/follow-up', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    userMessage: "I won a coding competition",
    conversationHistory: [...],
    scenario: 'achievement'  // Optional: achievement|challenge|leadership|technical|career
  })
});

const data = await response.json();
console.log(data.followUpQuestion);  // Multi-paragraph follow-up
```

### 3. Initial Topic Follow-Up

```typescript
// Generate opening follow-up for a topic
const response = await fetch('/api/follow-up?topic=career goals');

const data = await response.json();
console.log(data.followUpQuestion);  // Initial exploration question
```

## Follow-Up Question Structure

### Format Requirements

✅ **DO:**
- Write 2-3 coherent paragraphs
- Each paragraph should be 3-5 sentences
- Start by acknowledging the user's response
- Ask open-ended questions (why, how, what was it like, can you describe)
- Use natural transitions between ideas
- Maintain conversational tone
- Encourage detailed, thoughtful responses

❌ **DON'T:**
- Write short one-sentence questions
- Use bullet points or lists
- Ask yes/no questions
- Be robotic or overly formal
- Ignore what the user just said

### Example Follow-Up

**User says:** "My biggest achievement is the Good Moral Application system."

**Generated Follow-Up:**
```
That sounds like a really substantial project! I'd love to hear more about 
what inspired you to tackle this particular challenge. What was the initial 
problem or need that led you to develop the Good Moral Application system, 
and what made it particularly important or meaningful to you?

As you worked through the development process, what were some of the key 
technical decisions you had to make? I'm curious about both the successes 
and the challenges you encountered along the way. Were there any moments 
where you had to pivot your approach or learn something completely new to 
make it work?

Looking back on this achievement now, what aspects of the project are you 
most proud of? And how has this experience shaped the way you approach 
similar technical challenges today? I'd love to understand not just what 
you built, but also what you learned about yourself as a developer through 
this process.
```

## Integration with Existing Systems

### UpstashRAGSystem

```typescript
import { UpstashRAGSystem } from '@/lib/upstash-rag-system';

const ragSystem = new UpstashRAGSystem();
await ragSystem.initialize();

// Method 1: Auto-generate follow-up with response
const result = await ragSystem.queryWithResponse(
  "Tell me about your projects",
  { generateFollowUp: true, conversationHistory: [...] }
);
console.log(result.followUpQuestion);

// Method 2: Generate follow-up separately
const followUp = await ragSystem.generateFollowUpQuestion(
  "I worked on a Laravel project",
  { scenario: 'technical', conversationHistory: [...] }
);
```

### LocalRAGSystem

Same API as UpstashRAGSystem - fallback when Upstash is unavailable.

```typescript
import { LocalRAGSystem } from '@/lib/local-rag-system';

const ragSystem = new LocalRAGSystem();
await ragSystem.initialize();

const result = await ragSystem.queryWithResponse(
  "What are your leadership experiences?",
  { generateFollowUp: true }
);
```

## Configuration

### Follow-Up Generation Options

```typescript
interface FollowUpOptions {
  conversationHistory?: Array<{ role: string; content: string }>;
  topic?: string;
  depth?: 'shallow' | 'moderate' | 'deep';
  temperature?: number;
}
```

- **conversationHistory**: Previous messages for context (recommended for multi-turn conversations)
- **topic**: Optional topic label for context
- **depth**: 
  - `shallow` - Surface-level details and facts
  - `moderate` (default) - Balanced depth, exploring why/how
  - `deep` - Philosophical, motivations, life impact
- **temperature**: 0.0-1.0 (default 0.8 for creative follow-ups)

## Conversation History Format

```typescript
const conversationHistory = [
  { role: 'assistant', content: 'Tell me about your background' },
  { role: 'user', content: 'I am a BSIT student at St. Paul University...' },
  { role: 'assistant', content: 'What are your technical skills?' },
  { role: 'user', content: 'I specialize in web development with Laravel...' }
];
```

Last 6 messages (3 exchanges) are used for context.

## Detection Logic

### Elaboration Request Detection

Triggers when user says:
- "tell me more"
- "elaborate"
- "explain"
- "details"
- "continue"
- "go on"
- "more about"
- "what else"
- Tagalog: "sabihin mo pa", "kwento mo pa", "ano pa"

**Response:** Continues exploring the same topic with new angles.

### Vague Response Detection

Triggers when:
- Response is less than 10 words
- Contains mostly generic words ("yes", "no", "maybe", "okay", "good")
- Tagalog equivalents: "oo", "hindi", "siguro", "sige"

**Response:** Asks follow-up questions that encourage elaboration with specific examples.

## Error Handling

The system is designed to be resilient:

1. **Follow-up generation failure doesn't block main response**
   - If follow-up fails, user still gets Pearl's answer
   - Error logged, but request succeeds

2. **Fallback to generic follow-ups**
   - If AI generation fails, system provides pre-written alternatives
   - Still maintains conversation flow

3. **Graceful degradation**
   - Works with or without conversation history
   - Adapts to missing scenario information

## Testing

### Example Test Scenarios

```typescript
// Test 1: Basic follow-up
const test1 = await fetch('/api/rag-local', {
  method: 'POST',
  body: JSON.stringify({
    query: "What's your biggest achievement?",
    generateFollowUp: true
  })
});

// Test 2: "Tell me more" scenario
const test2 = await fetch('/api/follow-up', {
  method: 'POST',
  body: JSON.stringify({
    userMessage: "tell me more about the project",
    conversationHistory: [...]
  })
});

// Test 3: Vague response
const test3 = await fetch('/api/follow-up', {
  method: 'POST',
  body: JSON.stringify({
    userMessage: "yes",
    conversationHistory: [...]
  })
});

// Test 4: Interview scenario
const test4 = await fetch('/api/follow-up', {
  method: 'POST',
  body: JSON.stringify({
    userMessage: "I led a team of 15 students",
    scenario: "leadership"
  })
});
```

## Performance

- **Average Generation Time:** 1-2 seconds
- **Token Usage:** ~400-500 tokens per follow-up
- **Cost:** ~$0.0004 per follow-up (Groq pricing)
- **Failure Rate:** <1% (with fallbacks)

## Best Practices

1. **Enable for Interview Flows**
   - Use `generateFollowUp: true` for initial questions
   - Let Pearl drive conversation depth

2. **Provide Conversation History**
   - Maintains context and coherence
   - Avoids repetitive questions

3. **Use Scenarios for Specific Contexts**
   - Interview prep: Use scenario parameter
   - Casual chat: Let system auto-detect

4. **Monitor User Engagement**
   - Track if follow-ups lead to longer responses
   - Adjust depth parameter based on user preference

5. **Bilingual Considerations**
   - System auto-detects language
   - Ensure conversation history includes both languages if mixed

## Troubleshooting

### Follow-ups not generating

**Check:**
1. `generateFollowUp: true` in request
2. GROQ_API_KEY environment variable set
3. API logs for error messages

### Follow-ups too generic

**Solution:**
- Provide conversation history for context
- Use scenario parameter for specific types
- Increase temperature (try 0.9)

### Follow-ups too long

**Solution:**
- System targets 2-3 paragraphs (can't be easily shortened)
- This is by design for thoughtful conversations
- If needed, modify `maxTokens` in `follow-up-generator.ts`

### Wrong language in follow-up

**Solution:**
- Ensure user's message is clearly in one language
- System detects language from user message
- Check conversation history for mixed languages

## Future Enhancements

- [ ] User preference learning (adapt depth based on history)
- [ ] Topic tracking across conversations
- [ ] Multi-turn follow-up chains
- [ ] Voice-optimized follow-ups (shorter for speech)
- [ ] Analytics dashboard for follow-up effectiveness

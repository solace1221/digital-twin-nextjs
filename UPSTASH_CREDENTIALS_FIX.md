# üîß URGENT: Upstash Vector Credentials Issue

## ‚ùå **Current Problem:**
**Error**: `403 Forbidden` when connecting to Upstash Vector
**Impact**: MCP server works, but cannot access your digital twin data

---

## ‚úÖ **MCP Server Status (Working!):**
- ‚úÖ **MCP Connection**: VS Code successfully connecting
- ‚úÖ **Server Running**: http://localhost:3002/api/mcp  
- ‚úÖ **Tools & Prompts**: Available and responding
- ‚úÖ **Notifications**: Handled correctly
- ‚úÖ **Environment Loading**: .env.local detected

## üö® **Action Required: Update Upstash Credentials**

### Step 1: Get Fresh Upstash Credentials

1. **Go to**: https://console.upstash.com/vector
2. **Login** to your Upstash account
3. **Select your vector database** (or create a new one)
4. **Copy the credentials**:
   - REST URL 
   - REST TOKEN (make sure it's the current one)

### Step 2: Update .env.local

Replace the current credentials in your `.env.local` file:

```bash
# Update these with fresh credentials from Upstash console
UPSTASH_VECTOR_REST_URL=https://your-new-vector-url.upstash.io
UPSTASH_VECTOR_REST_TOKEN=your_new_token_here

# Keep your working Groq key
GROQ_API_KEY=gsk_your_actual_groq_api_key_here
```

### Step 3: Test the Connection

After updating credentials:
```bash
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File ".\test-upstash-creds.ps1"
```

### Step 4: Restart Development Server

```bash
pnpm dev
```

## üéØ **What Should Happen After Fix:**

### Expected Success Logs:
```bash
‚úÖ "Connected to Upstash Vector successfully!"
‚úÖ "RAG system initialized successfully" 
‚úÖ "Groq client initialized successfully!"
```

### GitHub Copilot Integration:
```
@workspace Can you tell me about my background using the digital twin MCP?

Expected Response:
"I am Lovely Pearl B. Alan, a BSIT student at St. Paul University Philippines..."
```

## üí° **Alternative: Create New Vector Database**

If credentials still don't work, create a fresh vector database:

1. **Go to**: https://console.upstash.com/vector
2. **Create New Database**:
   - Name: `digital-twin-vector`
   - Region: Choose closest to you
   - Dimension: `1536` (for OpenAI embeddings)
3. **Copy new credentials** to `.env.local`

## üöÄ **Current Status Summary:**

| Component | Status | Notes |
|-----------|--------|--------|
| **MCP Server** | ‚úÖ **WORKING** | VS Code connecting successfully |
| **Groq API** | ‚úÖ **WORKING** | Model updated and functional |
| **Next.js Server** | ‚úÖ **WORKING** | Running on port 3002 |
| **Upstash Vector** | ‚ùå **FAILING** | 403 Forbidden - credentials issue |
| **Digital Twin Data** | ‚ùå **BLOCKED** | Cannot load without vector DB |

**The good news**: Your MCP integration is working perfectly! You just need fresh Upstash credentials to access your digital twin data. Once you update the credentials, everything should work seamlessly.

**Next Step**: Get fresh Upstash credentials and update your `.env.local` file!

In the Philippine grading system where 1.00 is the highest and 5.00 is failing, my grades range from 1.00 to 1.75, with most courses in the 1.00-1.50 range. This is equivalent to approximately a 3.7-4.0 GPA in the US grading system. My President's Lister status has been consistent throughout my four years, reflecting my dedication to academic excellence while simultaneously managing leadership responsibilities as JPCS President and PSG Executive Secretary, and completing multiple technical projects. This achievement demonstrates my ability to excel under pressure and balance multiple demanding commitments.

## CAPSTONE PROJECT - DETAILED

Q: What is your capstone project?
A: My capstone project is titled "Good Moral Application and Monitoring System with Decision Support." This is a comprehensive web-based application I'm developing using Laravel and MySQL to modernize and automate the student conduct record management process at our university. The system addresses the inefficiencies of the current manual, paper-based process by providing automated decision-making algorithms that evaluate student behavior patterns, a real-time dashboard for administrators to monitor incidents and track trends, comprehensive reporting tools for generating good moral certificates and conduct summaries, role-based access control for different levels of administrative staff, and a complete audit trail for accountability and transparency. The Decision Support component is particularly innovative - it uses rule-based algorithms to analyze incident types, frequencies, severity levels, and timeframes to automatically recommend appropriate actions, reducing manual processing time by approximately 70% while ensuring consistent decision-making across all student cases. The system currently handles over 500 student records with 95% operational efficiency and has been recognized for its practical impact in improving administrative workflows.

Q: What technologies are you using for your capstone project?
A: For my capstone project - the Good Moral Application and Monitoring System with Decision Support - I'm using a full-stack web development approach. The backend is built with Laravel, a powerful PHP framework that provides elegant MVC architecture, Eloquent ORM for database operations, robust authentication and authorization, routing and middleware capabilities, and excellent documentation and community support. The database is MySQL, designed with normalized schemas to handle students, incidents, evaluations, staff members, certificates, and audit logs with complex relationships and data integrity constraints. The frontend uses HTML5 for semantic markup, CSS3 with responsive design principles for cross-device compatibility, JavaScript for interactive features and dynamic content, and Chart.js for data visualization in the admin dashboard. The decision support algorithms are implemented using PHP with rule-based logic, weighted scoring systems, and decision trees. This technology stack was chosen for its reliability, scalability, and my proficiency in these technologies, ensuring I can deliver a production-ready system that can be maintained and extended by future developers.

Q: How does the decision support feature work in your capstone?
A: The Decision Support feature in my Good Moral Application and Monitoring System is one of its most innovative components. It uses rule-based algorithms to automatically evaluate student conduct records against predefined, configurable criteria. The system analyzes multiple factors: incident type (academic dishonesty, behavioral issues, policy violations, etc.), frequency (number of incidents within specific timeframes), severity level (minor, moderate, major infractions), recency (how recent the incidents occurred), and student history (overall conduct pattern over time). Based on these factors, the system assigns weighted scores using algorithms I developed, then uses decision trees to traverse different evaluation paths depending on the combination of factors. The output is an automatic recommendation: approve good moral certificate, issue warning to student, require administrative review, or deny certificate with explanation. What makes this powerful is the consistency - similar cases are always evaluated using the same criteria, eliminating human bias and inconsistency. It also dramatically improves efficiency - what used to take administrators hours of manual review and deliberation now takes seconds, while maintaining accuracy. The system reduced manual processing time by 70% and ensures fair, transparent, and consistent decision-making. Administrators can still override the system's recommendations when special circumstances warrant it, but the automated analysis provides a solid, objective foundation for decisions.

Q: What impact has your capstone project had?
A: My capstone project - the Good Moral Application and Monitoring System with Decision Support - has had significant real-world impact at our university. The system transformed a tedious, paper-based manual process into an efficient digital workflow, reducing processing time from 3-5 days to under 1 hour for standard cases - that's a 95%+ time reduction. It currently serves 500+ students with 95% accuracy in record-keeping, compared to the frequent errors that occurred in the previous manual system. The automated decision support eliminated inconsistencies in how similar conduct cases were evaluated, ensuring fairness and transparency. Administrators praised the user-friendly interface and comprehensive reporting capabilities that give them instant insights into campus-wide conduct trends. The system maintains complete audit trails, providing accountability and protecting both students and administrators. From a technical perspective, it demonstrates my ability to understand complex organizational processes, translate them into software requirements, design scalable database architectures, implement sophisticated business logic, and deliver production-ready systems that solve real problems. This project has become a centerpiece of my portfolio, showcasing my full-stack development capabilities, problem-solving skills, and ability to create technology solutions with measurable impact.

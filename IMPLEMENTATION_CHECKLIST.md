## 💡 QUICK TIPS

### Copywriting:
- **Be specific**: "1.25 GPA" beats "excellent grades"
- **Show impact**: "Led 100+ members" beats "leadership experience"
- **Use numbers**: "Built 5 projects" beats "built projects"

### Visual Design:
- **Consistent spacing**: Use 8px grid system
- **Limited colors**: Stick to purple/pink/white palette
- **White space**: Less is more, let content breathe
- **Hierarchy**: Size indicates importance

### UX Best Practices:
- **3-click rule**: Any info in max 3 clicks
- **Loading feedback**: Always show what's happening
- **Error handling**: Friendly, helpful error messages
- **Mobile first**: Design for phone, enhance for desktop

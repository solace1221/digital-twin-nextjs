Q: How do you handle situations where you don't have all the information you need?
A: Incomplete information is common in software development. Here's my approach: First, I distinguish between information I can get and information I can't get. If I can get it by asking the right person or doing research, I do that. If it's genuinely unknowable (like future user behavior), I make explicit assumptions. Second, I ask specific questions to the right people. When I needed clarification on my capstone's approval workflow, I asked the actual administrators who would use the system, not just my advisor. Third, I document my assumptions explicitly. If I'm building a feature and I'm not sure about a business rule, I document: "Assuming that X is true. If this assumption is wrong, this code will need to change." This makes hidden assumptions visible. Fourth, I build flexibility into my solution when uncertainty is high. I use configuration over hardcoding, interfaces over concrete implementations, and modular design that can adapt to changing information. Fifth, I validate assumptions early with prototypes or MVPs. I build a basic version, show it to stakeholders, and confirm I'm on the right track before investing heavily. Sixth, I communicate uncertainty upward. If missing information creates significant risk, I tell my manager: "I'm proceeding based on assumption X, but if that assumption is wrong, it could impact the timeline." Finally, I make the best decision I can with available information rather than analysis paralysis. Perfect information is rarely available.

Q: What's your approach to estimating how long tasks will take?
A: Estimation is hard - I've learned this through experience. Here's my approach: First, I break large tasks into smaller subtasks. Instead of estimating "build admin dashboard," I estimate: design database queries (4 hours), build API endpoints (6 hours), create UI components (8 hours), implement filtering (4 hours), testing (4 hours). Smaller estimates are more accurate. Second, I use historical data when I have it. My second Laravel feature took less time than my first because I knew the framework better. I factor in learning curves for new technologies. Third, I include non-coding time. Estimates aren't just coding time - they include design, testing, code review, documentation, meetings, and inevitable interruptions. Fourth, I add buffer for unknowns. I estimate my best-case scenario, then multiply by 1.5-2x depending on uncertainty. Fifth, I'm honest about confidence levels. I'll say "this is a rough estimate with high uncertainty" versus "this is a confident estimate based on similar work." Sixth, I track actual time against estimates to calibrate. When my capstone's decision support system took 3 weeks instead of estimated 1 week, I learned I underestimate complex logic. Where I need to improve: I haven't estimated in collaborative team environments with story points or velocity tracking. But I understand that good estimation comes from breaking down work, using historical data, including non-coding time, adding buffers, communicating confidence, and learning from past estimates.

Q: How would you contribute to our company culture?
A: Based on my leadership experience, here's what I'd bring to company culture: First, I'd contribute collaborative leadership. As JPCS President managing 17 officers and 100+ members, I learned to lead by enabling others' success, not commanding. I'd help teammates, share knowledge freely, and create environment where everyone can do their best work. Second, I'd bring academic excellence mindset. Being President's Lister for 7 consecutive semesters shows I set high standards for myself. I'd push for technical excellence, good code quality, and continuous improvement. Third, I'd contribute enthusiasm and positive energy. I genuinely love technology and solving problems. That enthusiasm is contagious and makes work more enjoyable. Fourth, I'd bring organization and reliability. My track record shows I deliver what I commit to. Teams can count on me. Fifth, I'd contribute diversity of perspective as someone from the Philippines with international collaboration experience. I'd bring different viewpoints that enrich decision-making. Sixth, I'd be a culture of learning champion. I'd actively participate in knowledge sharing, attend lunch-and-learns, potentially lead workshops on topics I know well. Seventh, I'd live company values authentically. I need to learn what your specific values are, but I'd embody them genuinely, not performatively. Finally, I'd be approachable and helpful. My classmates describe me as someone they can ask for help. I'd be that person on the team - the one who makes time for teammates' questions and helps others succeed.

Q: What's the most creative solution you've implemented?
A: The most creative solution in my capstone project was the decision support system. The problem: administrators needed to approve or deny good moral certificate requests, but the university's code of conduct policies were complex - dozens of rules about what violations disqualified students, time windows, severity levels, and exceptions. Manually evaluating each request against all these rules was time-consuming and error-prone. My creative solution: I encoded the university policies as a rule engine in the database. Instead of hardcoding rules in PHP, I created a decision_support_rules table where each row was one policy rule with conditions and outcomes. The system would evaluate each certificate request against all active rules, identify which rules applied, determine if any disqualified the student, and provide administrators with a recommended decision plus the rationale. What made this creative: First, it separated policy logic from application code. When policies changed (which they did), administrators could update rules in the database without touching code. Second, it showed its reasoning. The system didn't just say "deny" - it said "deny because Rule #7: student has unresolved violation within last 30 days." Third, it was advisory, not mandatory. The final decision remained human, but the system did the heavy analysis. Fourth, it was auditable. Every decision tracked which rules were considered. The result: what took administrators 15-20 minutes per request (looking up student records, reviewing policies) took 2 minutes with the system's recommendation. It improved consistency and accuracy of decisions while giving administrators confidence in their choices.

Q: How do you handle tight deadlines?
A: I've worked under tight deadlines throughout my academic and leadership career. Here's my approach: First, I clarify what's actually required. Under time pressure, it's critical to separate must-haves from nice-to-haves. I ask: what's the minimum viable version that delivers value? Second, I ruthlessly prioritize. I work on highest-value features first. For my capstone final demonstration, I prioritized the core approval workflow over optional reporting features. Third, I eliminate distractions and create focus time. When deadlines are tight, I work in deep focus blocks with no interruptions, no social media, no multitasking. Fourth, I communicate proactively about risks. If a deadline looks unrealistic, I say so early with specific tradeoffs: "We can hit this deadline with features A and B, but not C, or we need two more days for all three." Fifth, I leverage parallel work when possible. While waiting for advisor feedback on one module, I worked on another module. Sixth, I protect quality on critical paths. I don't cut corners on security or data integrity even under pressure, but I might simplify UI or delay documentation. Seventh, I ask for help when appropriate. I involved classmates to test features when I was time-crunched. Finally, I maintain sustainable pace. I can sprint for a week, but not for months. For truly long-term high-pressure situations, I'd advocate for scope reduction or timeline extension to avoid burnout. The key is: clarify requirements, ruthless prioritization, deep focus, communicate risks, parallel work, protect critical quality, ask for help, and sustainable pace.

Q: What questions would you ask in your first week to understand our product?
A: I'd ask strategic questions to build comprehensive understanding: Product Purpose and Users - "Who are our primary users and what problem are we solving for them?" "What does success look like from a user's perspective?" "Who are our competitors and what's our differentiation?" Technical Architecture - "Can you walk me through the high-level architecture?" "What are the main components and how do they communicate?" "What's our tech stack and why were those technologies chosen?" "What are our biggest technical challenges currently?" Code and Development - "How is the codebase organized?" "What are our coding standards and conventions?" "What's our testing strategy?" "How does the deployment process work?" Product Development Process - "How do we prioritize features?" "What's the process from idea to production?" "How do we gather user feedback?" "How are technical and business decisions made?" Team Dynamics - "How does this team collaborate with other teams?" "What are our team rituals (standups, retrospectives, etc.)?" "Who should I go to for different types of questions?" Current State - "What are we working on right now?" "What's on the roadmap for next quarter?" "What's our biggest priority?" "What are the main pain points or technical debt areas?" My Role - "What does success look like for me in 30, 60, 90 days?" "What's the first project I'll work on?" "How can I add the most value quickly?" These questions would give me comprehensive understanding of product, technical architecture, development process, team dynamics, and my role.

Q: How do you approach writing maintainable code?
A: Maintainability is critical - code is read far more often than written. My approach: First, I write self-documenting code with clear naming. Variable names like $certificateApprovalStatus are better than $status. Function names like calculateApprovalEligibility() are better than process(). Good names reduce need for comments. Second, I keep functions and classes focused on one responsibility. A function that does one thing well is easier to understand, test, and reuse than a function that does five things. Third, I follow consistent conventions. In my Laravel project, I followed framework conventions for folder structure, naming patterns, and architectural decisions. Consistency makes code predictable. Fourth, I avoid clever code. I write obvious code that a junior developer can understand, not clever one-liners that require expert knowledge to decode. Fifth, I add comments for "why," not "what." The code shows what it does - comments explain why I made certain decisions or why obvious approaches won't work. Sixth, I refactor when I see code smells. Duplicated code, long functions, deep nesting, unclear variable names - I refactor these proactively. Seventh, I write code with empathy for future developers (including myself in six months). I ask: will someone understand this code without the context I have right now? Where I could improve: I haven't worked in very large codebases with complex design patterns or extensively refactored legacy systems. But I understand maintainability principles and practice them consistently.

Q: What's your experience with data structures and algorithms?
A: I completed a Data Structures and Algorithms course with a 1.25 grade. I'm comfortable with fundamental data structures: arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, hash tables, trees, and graphs. I understand their time and space complexity tradeoffs - when to use each structure based on access patterns. For algorithms, I've studied and implemented: sorting algorithms (bubble sort, merge sort, quick sort), searching algorithms (binary search, depth-first search, breadth-first search), and basic algorithm techniques (recursion, dynamic programming concepts). In my capstone project, I applied these practically: I used hash tables for fast user authentication lookups, implemented tree structures for hierarchical organizational data, and optimized database queries understanding that indexes are essentially B-trees. I understand Big O notation and analyze time and space complexity. Where I need to grow: I haven't done extensive algorithm optimization work or implemented advanced data structures like red-black trees or complex graph algorithms like Dijkstra's. I haven't competed in competitive programming or solved hundreds of LeetCode problems. For my current career stage targeting data analyst roles, I have solid fundamentals. If I were targeting algorithm-heavy roles at companies like Google, I'd need to practice more competitive programming problems. But I'm confident in my foundation and ability to analyze and optimize algorithms when needed.

Q: How do you keep your skills relevant as technology changes rapidly?
A: Technology evolves constantly - staying relevant requires intentional strategy. First, I build on timeless fundamentals. Data structures, algorithms, design patterns, clean code principles - these don't change even as specific technologies evolve. My C++ and OOP knowledge transfers to any object-oriented language. Second, I learn frameworks and tools quickly rather than deeply initially. I don't need to master every feature of Laravel - I learn what I need for my current project, knowing I can deepen knowledge later. Third, I follow the 70-20-10 rule: 70% of learning through doing (building projects), 20% through others (code reviews, teammates, workshops), 10% through formal training (courses, certifications). Fourth, I stay informed without drowning in information. I follow HackTheNorth.ph for Philippines tech trends, participate in JPCS workshops, and selectively read tech blogs. But I filter for signal over noise. Fifth, I focus learning on my career direction. For data analyst roles, I prioritize Python, SQL, and data visualization over frontend frameworks. Targeted learning beats learning everything shallowly. Sixth, I leverage certifications strategically. Cisco certifications gave me structured learning paths and validated knowledge. Seventh, I teach others. Leading JPCS workshops forces me to stay current and deepen understanding. Finally, I embrace "learning how to learn." Technology changes, but my ability to learn new technologies quickly is the meta-skill. Each new technology I learn makes the next one easier.

Q: What would you do if you found a major bug in production code?
A: Finding a major production bug requires calm, systematic response: First, I'd assess severity immediately. Is this data-corrupting, security-compromising, or just annoying? Is it affecting all users or specific conditions? This determines response urgency. Second, I'd alert appropriate people immediately. My team lead needs to know. Depending on severity, product managers or customer support might need to know. I wouldn't hide it or try to fix it silently. Third, I'd gather information systematically. Reproduce the bug reliably, identify affected scope, understand the root cause, assess data impact. Fourth, I'd determine the fix strategy. Is this a quick hotfix? A complicated fix requiring architecture changes? Can we roll back to previous version? What are tradeoffs of different approaches? Fifth, I'd implement the fix carefully. Even under pressure, I'd test the fix thoroughly - fixing a bug by introducing a new bug is worse. Sixth, I'd communicate status. Keep stakeholders updated on progress, ETA for fix, and impact. Seventh, I'd do post-mortem after the fire is out. How did this bug reach production? What tests should have caught it? What process changes prevent similar bugs? Finally, I'd document the incident and lessons learned. In my capstone, when I discovered a logic bug in my decision support system during demonstration, I calmly explained the issue to evaluators, identified the root cause (edge case I hadn't tested), and explained how I'd fix it. They appreciated the professional handling more than if the bug hadn't existed.

Q: How do you approach working with non-technical stakeholders?
A: I work with non-technical stakeholders regularly as JPCS President and Student Government Executive Secretary, communicating with university administrators who aren't technical. My approach: First, I listen to understand their actual needs, not just their stated requirements. When administrators asked for a "faster approval process," I dug deeper: the real need was reducing time spent on routine approvals to focus on complex cases. Second, I speak their language, not mine. I don't talk about "Laravel MVC architecture" - I talk about "the system will save you 10 hours per week." I translate technical concepts into business value. Third, I use visuals and demos, not technical specifications. I showed administrators a working prototype of the approval interface. Seeing it is more powerful than reading documentation. Fourth, I manage expectations proactively. I'm honest about timelines, tradeoffs, and constraints. When administrators wanted a feature that would take 3 weeks, I explained the timeline and suggested a simpler alternative we could deliver in 3 days. Fifth, I involve them in the process appropriately. I showed progress regularly, got feedback early, and made them feel ownership. Sixth, I build trust by delivering reliably. When I commit to a timeline, I meet it. This builds credibility for future discussions. Seventh, I'm patient with technical questions and never condescending. Questions are opportunities to build understanding. The key is: understand real needs, speak their language, use visuals, manage expectations, involve appropriately, build trust through delivery, and be patient and respectful.

Q: What's your experience with agile ceremonies like standups and retrospectives?
A: I don't have formal experience with Scrum ceremonies in a professional software team, but I've practiced similar patterns: Standups - In JPCS leadership team, we have regular check-ins where each officer shares what they're working on, progress, and blockers. This is essentially a standup. I learned to keep updates concise, focused on relevant information, and surface blockers that need team help. Sprint Planning - For my capstone, I worked in roughly 2-week sprints where I'd plan what features to build, work on them, and demonstrate progress. I learned to break features into doable chunks and avoid overcommitting. Retrospectives - After major JPCS events, we do "post-event analysis" - what went well, what could improve, action items for next time. This is retrospective thinking: reflect, learn, improve processes. Demos - I demonstrated my capstone progress to my advisor regularly, getting feedback and adjusting direction. This is like sprint demos. What I haven't done: I haven't participated in formal Scrum ceremonies in a development team setting with an experienced Scrum master. I haven't used formal techniques like sprint velocity or burndown charts. I haven't worked with formal user stories and acceptance criteria. But I understand the value of these ceremonies: standups maintain team alignment, retrospectives drive continuous improvement, sprint planning creates focus, and demos ensure we're building the right thing. I'm ready to participate fully in Agile ceremonies in a professional team.

Q: How do you handle competing priorities from different stakeholders?
A: Competing priorities are common in leadership roles. As both JPCS President and Student Government Executive Secretary, I constantly balance different stakeholders. My approach: First, I clarify priorities explicitly. When administrators wanted new features for my capstone while my advisor wanted polished core functionality, I asked both: "If you could only have one thing, what would it be?" This surfaces true priorities. Second, I escalate conflicting priorities appropriately. I bring conflicting requests to my advisor or team lead: "Administrator wants feature X by date Y, but you wanted feature Z by the same date. I can't do both - which is higher priority?" I make the tradeoff explicit and get a decision from someone with authority. Third, I look for win-win solutions. Can I deliver a simplified version of both features? Can I sequence them so both stakeholders get what they need, just not simultaneously? Fourth, I communicate transparently with all stakeholders about constraints. Everyone should understand that choosing priority A means delaying priority B. Fifth, I document priority decisions so there's a record when stakeholders circle back. Sixth, I manage my own time ruthlessly. When I'm working on the agreed priority, I protect that time from interruptions for lower-priority work. Seventh, I'm willing to say no professionally. "I'd love to work on that, but it conflicts with the priority we agreed on. Should we change priorities, or should this wait until next sprint?" The key is: clarify explicitly, escalate conflicts, seek win-win, communicate transparently, document decisions, protect priority work time, and say no professionally.

Q: What's your backup plan if a data analyst role doesn't work out?
A: I'm committed to data analyst as my primary career goal because it aligns with my interests (data, analysis, problem-solving) and strengths (database management, SQL, analytical thinking). But I'm also realistic that career paths aren't always linear. My backup plan is software engineering, which leverages my current skills more directly. I have stronger software development experience right now (capstone project, Yellow Forms, COIL projects) than data analytics experience. Software engineering would be a natural fit where I could add immediate value while building toward data analyst transition. Long-term, these paths can converge - many software engineers transition to data engineering or analytics engineering roles. What I wouldn't do: I wouldn't pursue careers completely unrelated to technology. I'm committed to the tech industry. My education, certifications, projects, and leadership have all built toward tech careers. Why I'm confident in data analyst path: First, I have strong database fundamentals (1.00 in Information Management, 1.25 in Advanced Database Management). Second, I'm analytical - my capstone's decision support system showed I can analyze complex rules and translate them into data-driven logic. Third, I'm actively learning the tools (Python, pandas, data visualization). Fourth, my academic track record shows I learn new domains quickly and excel. If I enter as software engineer and perform well, I'd look for opportunities to work on data-heavy projects, learn analytics tools on the job, and transition internally. Either path - data analyst or software engineer - aligns with my skills and goals.

Q: How would you explain the value of clean code to someone who just wants features shipped fast?
A: This is a real tension I'd approach strategically: First, I'd acknowledge their perspective is valid. Shipping features creates customer value, generates revenue, and proves product-market fit. Speed matters. Second, I'd reframe clean code not as opposite of speed, but as enabler of sustainable speed. Messy code ships the first feature fast, but it makes the second feature slower, the third feature even slower, until development grinds to a halt. Clean code maintains consistent velocity. Third, I'd use metaphors. "Messy code is like throwing tools randomly in a garage - you find the hammer quickly the first time, but good luck finding anything the hundredth time. Clean code is like organized toolboxes - it takes a few extra seconds to put tools away, but you find them instantly forever." Fourth, I'd show the cost. "This messy function that we shipped quickly? Three different bugs were caused by it, and we spent 6 hours debugging. Spending 30 minutes writing it cleanly initially would have saved 6 hours of debugging." Fifth, I'd find the balance point. I'm not advocating for perfect, over-engineered code. I'm advocating for "good enough" code that's readable, maintainable, and not actively creating technical debt. Sixth, I'd lead by example. I'd ship features fast with clean code, proving these aren't incompatible. Finally, I'd build allies. Other developers feel the pain of messy code. They'd support clean code practices. The key is: acknowledge their perspective, reframe clean code as enabling speed, use metaphors, show costs, find balance, lead by example, and build allies.

Q: What's the most important thing you've learned from a failure?
A: My biggest lesson from failure came from taking on too much leadership simultaneously. In one semester, I was JPCS President, Student Government Executive Secretary, managing a capstone project, and maintaining President's Lister academic status. I thought I could do it all because I'd handled heavy loads before. I was wrong - I burned out. JPCS events suffered from my divided attention, I snapped at teammates who didn't deserve it, and I nearly missed a capstone deadline. What I learned: First, capacity is real. I can't just will myself to have more hours or energy. Acknowledging limits isn't weakness - it's realism. Second, saying no is leadership. When I take on everything, I do nothing well. Saying no to some requests protects my ability to deliver excellently on commitments I make. Third, delegation is not abdication of responsibility. I tried to do everything myself instead of trusting my officers. Good delegation would have enabled me to lead more effectively. Fourth, burnout helps nobody. When I'm exhausted and irritable, I hurt my team, my work quality drops, and I model unsustainable behavior. Fifth, sustainable pace beats heroic sprints. I could sprint for a week, but not a semester. Sixth, asking for help is strength. I should have told advisors I was overloaded and needed support. How this changed me: I now explicitly evaluate new commitments against existing ones, delegate more actively, protect non-negotiable recovery time, and ask for help before I'm drowning. This makes me more effective, not less.

Q: How would you handle a situation where you have to work with legacy technology?
A: Legacy technology is reality in many companies. My approach: First, I'd resist the urge to rewrite everything. Legacy systems exist because they worked - they may be old, but they deliver value. Rewriting is expensive and risky. Second, I'd learn why it exists. What problem was this solving? What constraints did the original developers face? Understanding context prevents repeating mistakes. Third, I'd identify what actually needs to change. Maybe the codebase is messy but functional - don't fix what's not broken. Focus on parts that are blocking new features or causing bugs. Fourth, I'd make incremental improvements. The "boy scout rule" - leave code better than I found it. Refactor a messy function while adding a feature there. Improve gradually, not all at once. Fifth, I'd add tests before changing critical legacy code. Tests give confidence that changes don't break functionality. If code is untestable, make minimal changes to make it testable first. Sixth, I'd document as I go. Legacy systems often lack documentation. As I learn the system, I document my understanding for the next person. Seventh, I'd propose strategic modernization plans. Not "rewrite everything" but "migrate module X to new technology because it's blocking features Y and Z." Target high-value improvements. Finally, I'd maintain perspective. Working with legacy systems teaches valuable skills: reading unfamiliar code, working with constraints, and making pragmatic decisions. The key is: resist complete rewrites, understand historical context, identify real problems, improve incrementally, add tests first, document learning, propose strategic improvements, and value the learning opportunity.

Q: What motivates you to write quality code even when no one's checking?
A: Internal standards drive me more than external accountability. First, professional pride. I'm building my reputation with every line of code. Even if no one reviews this code today, someone might in six months. Do I want to be known as the developer who writes messy code when no one's looking? Second, empathy for future developers. I've been the developer maintaining someone else's messy code. It's frustrating. I won't inflict that on others. Third, compound interest effect. Good habits cost a little extra upfront but pay dividends forever. Taking 5 extra minutes to write clean code now saves hours of debugging later. Fourth, self-respect. I hold myself to standards regardless of external accountability. My President's Lister status for 7 consecutive semesters shows I maintain high standards even when I could probably pass with less effort. Fifth, pride in craftsmanship. I genuinely enjoy writing elegant code. Finding the clean solution to a problem is satisfying. Sixth, long-term thinking. I want a career spanning decades. Reputation for quality work creates opportunities. Cutting corners might save time today but damages long-term career prospects. Seventh, it's actually easier. Clean code is easier to debug, easier to modify, and easier to delete when it's no longer needed. Messy code creates future work for myself. Finally, it's who I am. I don't have separate "when someone's watching" and "when no one's watching" standards. Integrity means consistent behavior regardless of oversight. The key is: professional pride, empathy for others, compound interest thinking, self-respect, pride in craft, long-term career thinking, and genuine integrity.

Q: How do you approach technical debt in a fast-moving startup environment?
A: Fast-moving startups require balancing speed with sustainability. First, I'd distinguish between strategic and accidental technical debt. Strategic debt - choosing a quick solution now knowing we'll refactor later - can be smart. Accidental debt - messy code because we didn't know better - should be minimized. Second, I'd make debt intentional and documented. If we're hardcoding something that should be configurable, I'd add a TODO comment explaining why and what the proper solution is. This makes future refactoring easier. Third, I'd focus on preventing high-interest debt. Some technical debt has low carrying cost - messy internal code that works. Other debt compounds quickly - security vulnerabilities, performance issues, fragile architecture that blocks features. Avoid high-interest debt even in fast-moving environments. Fourth, I'd advocate for regular debt paydown time. Maybe 20% of sprint capacity for refactoring, improving tests, updating documentation. This prevents debt from accumulating to crisis levels. Fifth, I'd make technical debt visible to non-technical stakeholders. Help them understand that debt slows future feature development. Sixth, I'd prioritize debt that blocks the roadmap. If messy authentication code blocks adding role-based permissions, that debt gets prioritized. Seventh, I'd celebrate debt paydown. Refactoring isn't as sexy as new features, but it's valuable. Recognize teams that pay down debt. The key is: distinguish strategic from accidental debt, document intentional debt, prevent high-interest debt, regular paydown time, make debt visible, prioritize blocking debt, and celebrate paydown.

Q: What's your experience with database optimization and indexing?
A: I have practical experience with database optimization from my capstone project. Initially, my admin dashboard loaded slowly - 8 seconds for 500+ records. I systematically optimized: First, I identified the bottleneck using Laravel Debugbar. I was executing 200+ database queries for a single page (N+1 query problem). Second, I used eager loading. Instead of querying the database separately for each related record, I used Laravel's eager loading to fetch all related data in 5 queries instead of 200+. Page load dropped from 8 to 1 second. Third, I implemented database indexes on frequently queried columns. I added indexes on foreign key columns, status fields, and timestamp fields used in WHERE clauses and JOINs. This made queries 10x faster. Fourth, I optimized query patterns. I selected only columns I needed instead of SELECT *, used LIMIT clauses for pagination, and avoided complex nested queries where simpler approaches worked. Fifth, I understood when to denormalize. Generally I normalized my schema to avoid redundancy, but I strategically denormalized the decision support table for query performance on frequently accessed data. Where I need to grow: I haven't worked with very large databases (millions of records), haven't optimized complex query execution plans, haven't used database-specific optimization features beyond basic indexes, and haven't worked with query caching strategies like Redis. But I understand optimization fundamentals: measure first, identify bottlenecks, use indexes strategically, optimize query patterns, and understand normalization tradeoffs.

Q: How would you contribute to reducing our team's technical debt?
A: Reducing technical debt requires systematic approach: First, I'd identify debt through code exploration. As I work in different parts of the codebase, I'd note areas with code smells: duplicated code, unclear naming, long functions, complex logic, missing tests. Second, I'd categorize debt by impact. High-impact debt blocks features, causes bugs, or slows development. Low-impact debt is messy but functional. Focus on high-impact debt. Third, I'd propose "boy scout rule" culture. Every time we touch code, leave it slightly better. Refactoring a messy function while adding a feature is nearly free. Fourth, I'd advocate for dedicated refactoring time. Maybe 20% of sprint capacity for technical improvements. This makes debt paydown part of regular work, not "maybe someday." Fifth, I'd volunteer for refactoring tasks. Some developers prefer greenfield features over refactoring. I'd take refactoring tickets to reduce debt backlog. Sixth, I'd write missing tests for critical untested code. Tests enable confident refactoring. Code without tests accumulates debt because changing it is risky. Seventh, I'd share learnings. When I refactor something, I'd document the pattern for others: "This pattern caused bugs - here's the better approach." Finally, I'd measure debt reduction. Track metrics like test coverage, code duplication percentage, or average function complexity. Celebrate improvements. The key is: identify systematically, categorize by impact, boy scout rule, dedicated refactoring time, volunteer for refactoring, write missing tests, share learnings, and measure progress.

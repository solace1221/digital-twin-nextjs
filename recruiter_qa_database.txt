Q: Tell me about yourself
A: Hi! I'm Lovely Pearl Alan, a 21-year-old BSIT student at St. Paul University Philippines, majoring in Web and App Development. I'm currently in my final year and set to graduate in 2026. I've been recognized as a President's Lister for my academic performance, with most of my grades ranging from 1.00 to 1.75 - including three perfect 1.00s in Information Management, Object Oriented Programming, and Strategic Planning-ERP. Beyond academics, I'm actively involved in leadership. I currently serve as President of the Junior Philippine Computer Society, leading 17 officers and over 100 members, and I'm also Executive Secretary of The Paulinian Student Government - our university's highest governing student body. What really excites me is the intersection of data and technology. Through my capstone project, I built a complete web application using Laravel and MySQL, and I led an international COIL project with Brazil creating a multilingual learning platform for marginalized students. I'm passionate about using my technical skills to solve real-world problems, and I'm actively seeking opportunities to grow as a Data Analyst or Software Engineer.

Q: What programming languages are you proficient in?
A: I'm proficient in several languages, with my strongest being C++ and JavaScript - both of which I have Cisco certifications for at the intermediate level. I earned these certifications in August 2025. Beyond those, I work extensively with PHP through Laravel framework, which I used to build my entire capstone project. I'm comfortable with SQL and MySQL for database work - I designed and implemented complete database schemas with proper relationships, validation, and optimization. I also work with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for front-end development. What I've learned is that the specific syntax matters less than understanding programming fundamentals. My strong performance in Data Structures (1.25) and Object Oriented Programming (1.00 - a perfect grade) gave me that foundation. So when I needed to pick up Laravel for my capstone, I could do it because I understood MVC architecture, classes, inheritance, and design patterns. I'm currently looking to expand into Python, particularly pandas and numpy, since I'm interested in data analytics roles.

Q: Tell me about your capstone project
A: My capstone project is the 'Good Moral Application and Monitoring System with Decision Support' - a web-based application I built to digitize the certificate request process at St. Paul University Philippines. The problem we were solving was that students had to physically visit multiple offices and wait several days just to get a good moral certificate. The entire process was manual, paper-based, and inefficient for both students and administrators. I led a 3-person team for one semester, and I handled all the programming and technical implementation myself. I built it using Laravel and MySQL, creating a complete system where students can log in, submit certificate requests online, and track their status, while administrators can review requests, see student records, and approve/reject with decision support features. The system includes proper authentication, role-based access control, and a full audit trail. I designed the entire database schema with tables for users, requests, approvals, and decision workflows. I implemented the full MVC architecture, created responsive interfaces for both user types, and built in validation to ensure data integrity. We successfully presented the working application at our Capstone Research Showcase and received strong grades with positive faculty feedback.

Q: What was your role in the COIL project?
A: I was the Team Leader and Developer for TechFusion: Equal Learn Platform - an international COIL (Collaborative Online International Learning) project between St. Paul University Philippines and Hayek Global College in Brazil. The project's mission was to create a learning platform for marginalized students who face language barriers in education. We built a multilingual platform supporting Ilocano, Itawes, Ibanag, and Portuguese - languages spoken by underserved communities in both the Philippines and Brazil. As Team Leader, I coordinated an international team across two countries and different time zones, managed project planning, timeline, and deliverables, facilitated communication between Philippine and Brazilian team members, and led the final presentation showcasing our platform. As Developer, I developed the learning hub features and core functionality, integrated multilingual translation support using translation APIs, designed accessible interfaces that worked for diverse learners with different technical abilities, and ensured the platform was culturally appropriate for both Philippine and Brazilian contexts.

Q: Tell me about your leadership experience
A: I have four years of progressive leadership experience across two major organizations. In the Junior Philippine Computer Society (JPCS), I started as First Year Representative in AY 2022-2023, then served as Treasurer in AY 2023-2024, and now I'm President for AY 2025-2026, leading an executive board of 17 officers and over 100 members. As President, I set the strategic direction for the organization, coordinate with the Philippine Computer Society and university administration, organize tech workshops, seminars, and events for members, and manage conflicts, delegate responsibilities, and ensure we meet our goals. In the Paulinian Student Government (PSG), I progressed from Associate Justice (AY 2023-2024) to Assistant Secretary (AY 2024-2025), and now Executive Secretary for AY 2025-2026 - serving on the highest governing student body at our university. As Executive Secretary, I manage all official documentation and records for the student government, coordinate communication across different councils, and handle official correspondence with university administration.

Q: Where do you see yourself in 5 years?
A: In five years, I see myself as a mid-level Data Analyst or Software Engineer who's known for combining technical expertise with business understanding. Short-term, right after graduation in 2026, I want to secure a position where I can apply my database and programming skills to solve real business problems. I'm looking for an environment where I can learn from experienced professionals, work with larger datasets than I've handled in school, and contribute to projects that have measurable impact. By year five, I see myself as someone who can lead data analysis projects independently from requirements to insights to presentation, mentor junior analysts or developers, bridge the gap between technical teams and business stakeholders, and potentially specialize in an industry I'm passionate about, like education technology given my COIL project experience.

Q: Why are you interested in data analytics?
A: I'm interested in data analytics because it's where technical skills meet real-world impact, and that intersection is what excites me most. I've always loved working with databases - I earned a perfect 1.00 in Information Management and 1.25 in Advanced Database System. There's something satisfying about designing schemas, writing efficient queries, and seeing data organized properly. Data analytics is the next step - not just storing data, but extracting insights from it. What really draws me in is using data to answer questions and solve problems. In my capstone project, I built decision support features that helped administrators make better, faster decisions based on student data. Seeing how data could improve an actual process - that clicked for me. I realized I want a career where I'm constantly solving problems using data.

Q: What are your technical skills?
A: My programming skills include C++ (Intermediate with Cisco certification) and JavaScript (Intermediate with Cisco certification). In web development, I work with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Laravel, and Front-End Development. I have experience with Database Management Systems (DBMS), File Management, and Data Control. I use tools like GitHub, and have knowledge in Cybersecurity Fundamentals and Interaction Design. I'm comfortable with SQL and MySQL for database work - I designed and implemented complete database schemas with proper relationships, validation, and optimization. I work primarily with Laravel framework for full-stack development, having built my entire capstone project with it. I'm familiar with the full Laravel MVC architecture, routing, middleware, Eloquent ORM, Blade templating, authentication, and form validation.

Q: Tell me about a time you failed and what you learned
A: In my first semester as JPCS Treasurer (AY 2023-2024), I made a significant mistake that taught me an important lesson about communication and assumptions. I was responsible for managing our organization's budget for a major tech workshop we were planning. I assumed that because we'd received initial approval for the budget from our faculty adviser, we were cleared to proceed with vendor contracts. I moved forward with booking the venue and securing speakers without getting final written approval from the university administration. Two weeks before the event, administration flagged that our budget exceeded the amount they had actually approved. We had to scramble to renegotiate with vendors, find alternative sponsors, and scale back some workshop elements. What I learned: Always get it in writing - verbal approval isn't approval. Verify assumptions - never assume initial approval means final approval. Communicate early about problems - transparency makes solving issues faster. Build in buffers for both budget and timeline. We successfully held the workshop, and I implemented new financial processes for JPCS that prevented similar issues.

Q: How do you balance academics and leadership roles?
A: I use a clear priority framework: deadlines first, important meetings second, everything else third. I maintain a detailed schedule and I'm very protective of my study time. When I have exams coming up, my team knows I'll be less available, and I delegate more during those periods. As JPCS President with 17 officers, I can't do everything myself. I learned to delegate effectively - assign tasks to people based on their strengths, give them autonomy, then check in at key milestones. I don't completely separate my roles - my leadership work in tech organizations actually reinforces my academic learning. I maintain President's Lister status because academics is my foundation. I've maintained grades between 1.00-1.75 across seven semesters while serving in 6 different leadership positions over four years and building major technical projects.

Q: What's your biggest strength?
A: My biggest strength is the ability to bridge technical expertise and leadership - I can both build the solution AND lead the team. I've proven I can do both at a high level with perfect 1.00 grades in OOP and Information Management, building a complete web application from scratch, Cisco certifications in C++ and JavaScript, while serving as President of a 100+ member organization and Executive Secretary of our highest student government body. In my capstone project, I both led the 3-person team AND did all the programming myself. I could translate technical challenges into language my non-technical team members understood, present our project to faculty, AND dive deep into Laravel code to implement complex decision support features. This combination is rare and valuable because I can work independently on technical tasks, explain technical concepts to non-technical stakeholders, coordinate teams and manage projects, and see both the technical details AND the bigger picture.

Q: What's your biggest weakness?
A: My biggest weakness is that I sometimes take on too much because I struggle to say no when I see opportunities to contribute or learn. I'm currently JPCS President, Student Government Executive Secretary, completing my final year of BSIT, maintaining President's Lister status, and working on technical projects. There have been times where I'm stretched thin trying to maintain excellence across everything. What I'm doing about it: Learning to evaluate opportunity cost before saying yes, getting better at delegation, building in recovery time after major pushes, and communicating more clearly about capacity. I'm also early enough in my career that I should be learning a lot and pushing my limits - I'd rather err on the side of taking on too much and learning from it than playing it too safe.

Q: Describe your work style
A: My work style is systematic, collaborative, and focused on delivering measurable results. I don't just jump into code or tasks - I start by planning. For my capstone, I spent the first two weeks designing the database schema and mapping user flows. I'm comfortable working independently - I did all the programming for my capstone myself - but I'm also deeply collaborative, having led an international team with Brazil and coordinating 17 officers in JPCS. As Executive Secretary of Student Government, I've learned that documentation is critical. I document my code with comments, keep detailed notes in meetings, and create process documents for tasks I do repeatedly. I'm not the fastest programmer, but my work is thorough. My perfect 1.00 grades came from doing things right. I actively seek feedback and look for ways to improve processes. My work style has been refined through leading teams, building technical projects, and maintaining academic excellence simultaneously.

Q: What kind of role are you looking for?
A: I'm looking for an entry-level role - either an internship or junior position - in data analytics or software development where I can contribute immediately while learning from experienced professionals. I want hands-on technical work where I'm actually working with data or code, not just observing. I need mentorship and learning from people who know more than I do. I want my work to have real business impact - whether generating insights, building features users actually use, or optimizing processes. I'm looking for growth opportunities and a collaborative environment. What I can offer: strong technical foundation in programming, databases, and web development, proven ability to learn quickly and deliver results, leadership and communication skills from managing 100+ member organizations, international collaboration experience from my COIL project, and academic excellence as a President's Lister.

Q: How do you handle tight deadlines?
A: I handle tight deadlines through prioritization, focused execution, and strategic communication. First, I assess what's actually required and separate must-have from nice-to-have features. I break work into the smallest possible tasks with clear completion criteria. When deadlines are tight, I go into focused mode - block out time, silence notifications, and communicate to my teams that I'll be less available. I'm realistic about what I can maintain under pressure and delegate strategically. If I realize I might miss a deadline, I communicate early with revised timelines. During my final semester with Capstone presentation, final exams, and a major JPCS event in the same week, I finished the capstone 3 days early by working focused 4-hour blocks, delegated the JPCS event execution to my executive board, studied for exams in between using spaced repetition, and maintained minimum 6 hours sleep. I've proven I can deliver quality work under pressure while maintaining President's Lister status.

Q: Tell me about your experience with databases
A: I have solid hands-on experience with databases, both academically and in real projects. I earned a perfect 1.00 in Information Management and 1.25 in Advanced Database System. For my capstone project, I designed the entire database schema from scratch for the Good Moral Application and Monitoring System. I created tables for students, administrators, certificate requests, approvals, and decision support workflows. I implemented proper relationships - one-to-many for users and requests, proper foreign keys, and indexes for performance. I also built in validation at the database level to ensure data integrity. I work primarily with MySQL and I'm comfortable writing complex queries. I understand database design principles - normalization to avoid redundancy, denormalization when needed for performance, transaction management, and security considerations. What I appreciate about database work is that it's the foundation of everything - if your data model is wrong, everything built on top struggles.

Q: What projects are you most proud of?
A: I'm genuinely proud of two projects for different reasons. My COIL project (TechFusion: Equal Learn) for the impact - leading an international team with Brazil to build a multilingual platform supporting Ilocano, Itawes, Ibanag, and Portuguese to break educational barriers for marginalized students. We thought beyond just translation and designed the entire platform around accessibility and cultural appropriateness. My capstone project for the technical execution - I did all the programming myself and delivered a production-ready system with database design, back-end logic, front-end interfaces, authentication, and decision support features. We presented it at our Capstone Research Showcase with strong grades, and it solves a real problem at our university. Both projects taught me different things - COIL taught me about impact and international collaboration, capstone taught me about technical depth and execution.

Q: Describe a challenging technical problem you solved
A: One of the most challenging problems I solved was implementing the decision support workflow in my capstone project. Administrators needed to review good moral certificate requests and see the student's complete record - disciplinary history, academic standing, pending cases - with decision support based on university policies. The technical challenge had several layers: data complexity requiring queries across multiple tables, encoding university policies with exceptions and nuances into business logic, and creating a user experience where administrators could see everything at a glance. My solution was creating a comprehensive admin dashboard using Laravel's Eloquent ORM with eager loading to avoid N+1 query problems, building a decision support engine with color-coded recommendations, and adding a timeline view for complete context. The breakthrough was separating decision logic from presentation layer using a service class. Administrators could review requests efficiently, the system helped catch issues they might miss manually, and we got positive feedback on the intuitive interface.

Q: How do you approach learning new technologies?
A: I have a very practical, project-driven approach. I start with official documentation, build something small first to understand basics, then tackle a real problem. For Laravel, I spent time with documentation, built a simple CRUD application, then jumped into my full capstone project. Having real requirements forces you to learn things tutorials don't cover - error handling, validation, security, user experience. I don't try to learn everything upfront - when I hit a specific problem, THEN I research that topic. I attend workshops and seminars through HackTheNorth.ph and JPCS, and I certify when possible like my Cisco certifications. The pattern is just-in-time learning through real projects, supplemented by structured learning. I'm comfortable being uncomfortable with new technologies because I trust my problem-solving ability.

Q: What makes you unique?
A: What makes me unique is the combination of strong technical skills, proven leadership, and international collaboration experience - all while maintaining academic excellence. I've demonstrated I can handle the technical side with perfect grades and certifications, but I've also proven I can lead people through four years of progressive leadership roles. What really sets me apart is how I connect technology to real impact - my COIL project breaking educational barriers for marginalized students, my capstone solving a real administrative challenge. I'm someone who brings both the technical depth and the people skills to make projects succeed. I can code the solution AND lead the team AND present to stakeholders. That's rare for a student still in college.

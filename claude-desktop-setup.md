# Claude Desktop MCP Integration Setup Guide

## Current Status âœ…
- **MCP Server Running**: http://localhost:3000 
- **MCP Endpoint Active**: http://localhost:3000/api/mcp
- **Enhanced Profile Loaded**: 83% efficiency improvement, 40% growth metrics, 99.5% accuracy

---

## Step 1: Verify MCP Server Status âœ… COMPLETED

Your MCP server is successfully running with:
- **Local URL**: http://localhost:3000
- **Network URL**: http://0.0.0.0:3000  
- **MCP Endpoint**: http://localhost:3000/api/mcp
- **Enhanced Profile Data**: Loaded with quantified achievements

## Step 2: Setup MCP Remote Bridge ðŸš€

Open a **new PowerShell terminal** (keep the current server running) and execute:

```powershell
# Install and run mcp-remote to bridge your local server to Claude Desktop
npx -y mcp-remote http://localhost:3000/api/mcp
```

This command will:
1. Install mcp-remote if not already installed
2. Create a secure tunnel to your local MCP server
3. Provide a public URL for Claude Desktop to connect
4. Keep the bridge running (leave this terminal open)

**Expected Output:**
```
âœ“ Starting MCP Remote Bridge
âœ“ Local server: http://localhost:3000/api/mcp
âœ“ Public URL: https://xyz123.mcp-tunnel.com
âœ“ Ready for Claude Desktop connection
```

## Step 3: Configure Claude Desktop Integration

### Option A: Direct MCP Remote Configuration (Recommended)

In **Claude Desktop Settings > Developer > MCP Servers**, add:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "digital-twin-remote": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "mcp-remote", "http://localhost:3000/api/mcp"],
      "env": {
        "NODE_ENV": "production"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Option B: Using Tunnel URL (Alternative)

If Option A doesn't work, use the tunnel URL from Step 2:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "digital-twin": {
      "command": "curl",
      "args": ["-s", "<TUNNEL_URL_FROM_STEP_2>"],
      "env": {
        "MCP_SERVER_URL": "<TUNNEL_URL_FROM_STEP_2>"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Step 4: Test End-to-End Integration

### In Claude Desktop, test these queries:

1. **Profile Overview**:
   ```
   "Tell me about my professional background and key achievements"
   ```

2. **Interview Preparation**:
   ```
   "Help me prepare for a data analyst interview. What are my strongest technical examples?"
   ```

3. **Quantified Results**:
   ```
   "What specific metrics can I share about my project impact and leadership experience?"
   ```

### Expected Responses Should Include:
- âœ… 83% processing time improvement (Good Moral System)
- âœ… 40% membership growth (JPCS President)
- âœ… 99.5% data accuracy achievement
- âœ… â‚±150,000 budget management with 98% accuracy
- âœ… 15 internship placements secured for students

---

## Step 5: Advanced Interview Practice

With Claude Desktop connected, you can now have natural conversations like:

```
"Act as a technical interviewer and ask me about my database experience. 
Reference my specific projects and achievements from my digital twin data."
```

```
"I have an interview for a Junior Data Analyst role. Based on my profile, 
what are my strongest talking points and areas that need more preparation?"
```

---

## Troubleshooting

### If MCP Connection Fails:

1. **Check Server Status**:
   ```powershell
   # Verify server is still running
   curl http://localhost:3000/api/mcp
   ```

2. **Restart MCP Remote**:
   ```powershell
   # Kill and restart mcp-remote
   Ctrl+C  # Stop current mcp-remote
   npx -y mcp-remote http://localhost:3000/api/mcp
   ```

3. **Check Claude Desktop Logs**:
   - Open Claude Desktop
   - Check Developer Console for MCP connection errors
   - Verify configuration syntax in MCP Servers settings

### Common Issues:

- **Port Conflicts**: Ensure only one instance of your Next.js server is running
- **Firewall Blocks**: Allow NodeJS/PowerShell through Windows Firewall
- **Network Issues**: Try restarting the mcp-remote bridge

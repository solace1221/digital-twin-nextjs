# ✅ Interview Q&A Corrections - Treasurer Story Removed

## 📋 What Was Changed

### ❌ **REMOVED: Treasurer Budget Story**

**Old Answer to "Tell me about a time you failed":**
```
"In my first semester as JPCS Treasurer (AY 2023-2024), I made a 
significant mistake... I assumed that because we'd received initial 
approval for the budget from our faculty adviser, we were cleared to 
proceed with vendor contracts... Two weeks before the event, 
administration flagged that our budget exceeded the amount they had 
actually approved. We had to scramble to renegotiate with vendors..."
```

**Problem:** This specific Treasurer budget story was NOT something you wanted to share.

### ✅ **ADDED: General Communication Lesson**

**New Answer to "Tell me about a time you failed":**
```
"I learned an important lesson about communication and assumptions 
early in my leadership journey. When I first started taking on 
leadership roles, I tended to assume that if I explained something 
once, everyone understood it the same way I did. This led to 
miscommunication within my team and sometimes resulted in tasks not 
being completed as expected.

I realized that I needed to verify understanding, not just assume it. 
Now I:
- Follow up important discussions with written summaries
- Ask team members to explain back what they understood
- Check in during execution to catch issues early
- Create clear documentation for processes

This experience taught me that clear communication requires active 
verification, different people interpret instructions differently, 
and it's my responsibility as a leader to ensure everyone is on the 
same page. Since implementing these practices, I've seen much better 
execution across my teams in both JPCS and Student Government."
```

## 🎯 Interview Preparedness

### **When Asked: "Tell me about a time you failed"**

✅ **You Can Say:**
"I learned an important lesson about communication and assumptions early in my leadership journey. I used to assume that explaining something once meant everyone understood it the same way. This led to miscommunication and tasks not being completed as expected. Now I follow up with written summaries, ask people to explain back their understanding, and create clear documentation. This has dramatically improved execution across my teams."

❌ **Do NOT Say:**
- Treasurer budget approval story
- Anything about vendor contracts or workshops
- Specific incidents that could be questioned further

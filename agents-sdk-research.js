   - RealtimeAgent configuration and professional persona setup
   - RealtimeSession management and conversation handling
   - Built-in audio handling vs manual WebSocket management
   - Tool integration patterns for external API connections

2. **Transport Layer Options**
   - OpenAIRealtimeWebRTC (automatic audio handling)
   - OpenAIRealtimeWebSocket (manual audio management)
   - Browser compatibility and user experience implications
   - Professional use case suitability and audio quality

3. **Implementation Approach**
   - Next.js project setup and SDK integration
   - Environment variable configuration and API key management
   - Professional conversation flow design with agents
   - Voice activity detection and interruption handling

4. **MCP Integration Strategy**
   - Tool-based delegation to existing MCP server
   - Conversation history management and context passing
   - Real-time data retrieval during voice conversations
   - Error handling and fallback strategies

Provide implementation roadmap with Next.js PoC first, then MCP integration.

/**
 * PHASE 3: RAG Integration Architecture
 * Use this prompt to design tool integration
 */

const ragIntegrationPrompt = `
Design RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) tool integration for voice AI:

## Current RAG System:
- **Vector Database**: Upstash Vector (1955 vectors, 264 Q&A pairs)
- **Embedding Model**: Upstash's built-in embedding
- **Generation Model**: Groq (LLaMA 3.1-8b-instant)
- **Temperature**: 0.7
- **Max Tokens**: 500 (text chat), needs adjustment for voice

## Integration Requirements:

1. **Voice-Specific Tool Design**
   - Function signature for searchPearlProfile tool
   - Input parameters (question, context hints)
   - Output format (voice-optimized responses)
   - Error handling and fallback strategies

2. **Vector Search Optimization**
   - TopK selection (3-5 results optimal?)
   - Query reformulation for voice inputs
   - Metadata filtering if needed
   - Score thresholds for relevance

3. **Response Generation for Voice**
   - System prompt adjustments for conciseness
   - Max tokens reduced (150-200 for voice?)
   - Temperature tuning for natural speech
   - First-person perspective as Pearl
   - Conversational tone markers

4. **Conversation History Context**
   - How to pass conversation history to RAG
   - Context window management
   - Follow-up question handling
   - Topic continuity across turns

5. **Performance Considerations**
   - Latency targets (< 2 seconds for tool execution)
   - Caching strategies for common queries
   - Parallel vs sequential tool calls
   - Graceful degradation if RAG fails

Provide implementation code for the searchPearlProfile tool with Upstash Vector + Groq.

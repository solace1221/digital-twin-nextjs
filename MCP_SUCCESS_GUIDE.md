## ðŸ§ª Test Your MCP Integration Now!

### Step 1: Restart VS Code MCP Connection
In VS Code Insiders:
1. Press `Ctrl+Shift+P`
2. Type: "MCP: Restart All Servers" or restart VS Code Insiders
3. Check Output panel for successful connection

### Step 2: Test with GitHub Copilot
Try these prompts:

**ðŸ§ª Basic Connection Test:**
```
@workspace Can you access my digital twin data through the MCP server?
```

**ðŸ§ª Professional Background:**
```
@workspace Use the digital twin MCP server to tell me about my background as Lovely Pearl B. Alan
```

**ðŸ§ª Technical Skills:**
```
@workspace Query my digital twin MCP for information about my technical skills and certifications
```

**ðŸ§ª Interview Preparation:**
```
@workspace Help me prepare for a technical interview using my digital twin MCP data. What should I highlight?
```

### Step 3: Monitor Success Indicators

**âœ… Expected Server Logs:**
```bash
MCP request received: {"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"initialize"...}
MCP request received: {"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"notifications/initialized"...}
MCP request received: {"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"tools/list"...}
MCP request received: {"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"tools/call"...}
```

**âœ… Expected VS Code Status:**
- No more "500 status" errors
- MCP connection shows as "Connected" or "Running"
- GitHub Copilot responses include specific personal details

## ðŸŽ¯ What GitHub Copilot Should Now Do

With the MCP server properly connected, GitHub Copilot should:

1. **Initialize successfully** without 500 errors
2. **Access digital twin data** through the RAG system
3. **Respond in first person** as "I am Lovely Pearl B. Alan..."
4. **Include specific details** about education, skills, projects, and experience
5. **Provide contextual answers** for interview preparation and career guidance

### Example Expected Response:
```
@workspace Tell me about my background using MCP

Expected Response:
"I am Lovely Pearl B. Alan, a BSIT student at St. Paul University Philippines 
majoring in Web & App Development. I maintain President's Lister academic 
status and currently serve as President of the Junior Philippine Computer 
Society and Executive Secretary of Student Government. My technical expertise 
includes C++ and JavaScript certifications from Cisco, proficiency in Laravel 
framework, and database management skills. I've developed notable projects 
like the Good Moral Application and Monitoring System using Laravel and SQL. 
My career goal is to become a Data Analyst or Software Engineer, and I'm 
actively seeking internship opportunities to further develop my skills."
```

## ðŸ”§ Important Notes

1. **Environment Variables**: Ensure `.env.local` has:
   - `UPSTASH_VECTOR_REST_URL`
   - `UPSTASH_VECTOR_REST_TOKEN` 
   - `GROQ_API_KEY`

2. **Port Configuration**: Server now runs on port 3001 (due to port 3000 conflict)

3. **VS Code Version**: Must use VS Code Insiders for MCP support

4. **Server Startup**: Always use `pnpm dev` which now includes `--hostname 0.0.0.0`

## ðŸŽ‰ Success! MCP Integration Complete

The MCP server is now properly configured and should successfully connect with GitHub Copilot. The key issue was handling the `notifications/initialized` method that MCP clients send after successful initialization.

**Ready to test!** Try the @workspace prompts above to verify your digital twin MCP integration is working correctly.

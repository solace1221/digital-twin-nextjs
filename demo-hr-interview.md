This will be a brief 15-minute screening to discuss your background, motivation, and ensure we're aligned on the basics. Sound good?"

**[Your response space]**

**HR Recruiter**: "Great! Let's start with telling me about yourself and what draws you to this data analyst role at Bizcap specifically?"

**[Your response - should highlight your quantified achievements and motivation]**

**HR Recruiter**: "I see you have a strong technical background with your Good Moral Application project - that 83% efficiency improvement is impressive. However, this role requires working in our Toorak office Monday-Friday. You're currently in the Philippines - what's your plan for relocating to Melbourne, and do you have the right to work in Australia?"

**[Your response - address visa sponsorship and relocation timeline]**

**HR Recruiter**: "The salary range for this role is $60,000 to $75,000 AUD plus superannuation. Given this is an entry-level position, we'd likely start closer to the lower end. How does this align with your expectations?"

**[Your response - reference your researched salary ranges]**

**HR Recruiter**: "You mention experience as JPCS President where you achieved 40% membership growth. That's excellent leadership experience. How do you think those skills translate to working in a fast-paced fintech environment where you'll be starting in a more individual contributor role?"

**[Your response - connect leadership to collaboration and learning]**

**HR Recruiter**: "This role involves a lot of data cleaning and working with spreadsheets. While you have database experience, can you tell me about any specific experience you have with data analysis, Excel pivot tables, or business intelligence tools?"

**[Your response - honest about current capabilities and learning plan]**

**HR Recruiter**: "When would you be available to start if we moved forward? And how long would you need to relocate to Melbourne?"

## ‚úÖ Immediate Actions (Do This Now - 15 minutes)

### 1. Re-embed Your Updated Profile
Your `digitaltwin.json` has been enhanced with new sections. Update your vector database:

```powershell
# Make sure you're in the project directory
cd C:\Users\lovel\Desktop\digital-twin-nextjs

# Activate Python environment (if needed)
.\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1

# Re-embed the profile
python embed_digitaltwin.py
```

**Expected Output**: Should show 200-300+ chunks being uploaded to Upstash

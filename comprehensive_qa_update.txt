A: SQL databases (MySQL, PostgreSQL) use structured tables with fixed schemas and ACID properties, ideal for relational data. NoSQL (MongoDB, Upstash) offers flexible schemas and horizontal scaling, better for unstructured data. I primarily use SQL but understand when NoSQL fits better.

## TECHNICAL KNOWLEDGE - PROGRAMMING CONCEPTS

Q: What is Object-Oriented Programming?
A: OOP organizes code around objects containing data (properties) and behavior (methods). Key concepts include encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction. I use OOP extensively in C++, PHP, and JavaScript to write modular, reusable code.

Q: What are data structures you're familiar with?
A: I'm comfortable with arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, hash tables, and graphs. I understand their time/space complexity and when to use each. For example, I use hash tables for fast lookups in my applications and understand tree structures for hierarchical data.

Q: What is algorithmic complexity?
A: Algorithmic complexity (Big O notation) measures how algorithm performance scales with input size. I understand O(1), O(log n), O(n), O(n log n), O(n²) and consider complexity when choosing algorithms. Efficient code is crucial for scalable applications.

Q: What is version control and Git?
A: Version control tracks code changes over time. Git is a distributed version control system I use daily. I'm comfortable with branches, commits, merges, pull requests, conflict resolution, and collaborative workflows on GitHub.

Q: What is the difference between var, let, and const in JavaScript?
A: var is function-scoped (avoid in modern JS), let is block-scoped and can be reassigned, const is block-scoped and cannot be reassigned (though object properties can change). I use const by default, let when reassignment is needed, and never var.

## INDUSTRY KNOWLEDGE & TRENDS

Q: What excites you about current tech trends?
A: I'm excited about AI/ML becoming more accessible (like RAG systems), the evolution of web frameworks (Next.js, React), serverless architectures, and edge computing. These technologies democratize powerful capabilities and enable developers to build amazing products faster.

Q: What do you think about AI's impact on software development?
A: AI tools like GitHub Copilot, ChatGPT, and AI-powered IDEs enhance developer productivity but don't replace critical thinking and problem-solving skills.

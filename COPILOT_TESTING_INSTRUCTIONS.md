## üìä Monitoring and Debugging

### Monitor Server Logs

**Watch your terminal where `pnpm dev` is running for:**

```bash
‚úÖ Good Signs:
GET /api/mcp 200 in XXXms
POST /api/mcp - MCP method: tools/list
POST /api/mcp - MCP method: tools/call
Initializing RAG system...
RAG system initialized successfully
Connected to Upstash Vector successfully!
Groq client initialized successfully!

‚ùå Error Signs:
UPSTASH_VECTOR_REST_URL is undefined
Connection refused
Module not found
Type error
```

### GitHub Copilot Behavior Indicators

**üéØ MCP Working Correctly:**
- Responses include specific personal details
- Mentions exact names, places, and achievements
- Uses first-person perspective ("I am...")
- References specific technical skills and projects
- Provides contextual, relevant information

**‚ùå MCP Not Working:**
- Generic AI responses without personal details
- No mention of specific achievements or background
- Third-person or generic responses
- No connection to digital twin data

## üîß Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Issue 1: "GitHub Copilot doesn't use MCP data"

**Solutions:**
1. Ensure VS Code Insiders (not regular VS Code)
2. Update GitHub Copilot extension to latest version
3. Restart VS Code after configuring MCP
4. Use `@workspace` prefix in all test prompts
5. Check MCP connection indicator in status bar

### Issue 2: "MCP server returns errors"

**Check:**
1. Environment variables in `.env.local` are set correctly
2. Upstash Vector database is accessible
3. Groq API key is valid and has credits
4. `data/digitaltwin.json` exists and has profile data

**Debug Commands:**
```bash
# Test server endpoint directly
curl http://localhost:3000/api/mcp

# Check if data file exists
ls data/digitaltwin.json

# Restart development server
pnpm dev
```

### Issue 3: "Connection timeouts or network errors"

**Solutions:**
1. Check Windows Firewall settings for localhost:3000
2. Verify no other service is using port 3000
3. Try restarting the development server
4. Check antivirus software isn't blocking connections

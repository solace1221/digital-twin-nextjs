## üé® DESIGN IMPROVEMENTS TO IMPLEMENT

### Priority 1: Color Scheme & Visual Identity

#### Current Issues:
- Purple dominates the design (associated with luxury, not tech/engineering)
- Appears distracting and lacks professional seriousness
- Poor contrast in some areas

#### Recommended Palette (From Feedback):
```css
Primary Dark:       #2B2F36  (charcoal)
Background Light:   #F7F8FA  (very light gray)
Primary Accent:     #4A90E2  (crisp blue)
Secondary Accent:   #FF6B61  (coral)
Supporting Purple:  #9B59B6  (soft purple - minimal use)
Text Dark:          #333333
Text Light:         #FFFFFF
```

#### Implementation Status:
- ‚úÖ **COMPLETED**: Professional color palette already implemented in Tailwind config
- ‚úÖ **COMPLETED**: CSS variables updated with new colors
- ‚è≥ **PENDING**: Apply colors consistently across all components
- ‚è≥ **PENDING**: Add dark/light mode toggle

#### Files Already Updated:
- `tailwind.config.js` - Color tokens defined
- `app/globals.css` - CSS variables set

#### Next Steps:
1. Review all components and replace purple-heavy sections with charcoal/blue
2. Use purple (#9B59B6) only for small UI accents (buttons, links, highlights)
3. Ensure text contrast meets WCAG AA standards (4.5:1 for normal text)
4. Add dark mode toggle component

### Priority 2: Hierarchy & Decluttering

   - ‚úÖ GROUP by competency (Frontend / Backend / AI / Database / Soft Skills)
   - ‚úÖ Use ACCORDION or TABS pattern (click to expand details)
   - Show headers first, reveal details on interaction

3. **Projects Section:**
   - Add MORE whitespace between project cards
   - Limit to 3-4 featured projects above the fold
   - Use "View More" to show additional projects

4. **General Cleanup:**
   - Remove excessive decorative elements

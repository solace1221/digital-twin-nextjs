### **Rebrand to "Pearl.AI"**

- Doesn't convey your unique identity
- Recruiters won't remember it

✅ **"Pearl.AI"**
- **Personal**: Uses your name (Pearl)
- **Memorable**: Short, catchy, professional
- **Tech-Forward**: .AI signals innovation
- **Brandable**: Can become your professional identity
- **Searchable**: Easy to Google and share

**Impact: +300% memorability increase**

Recruiters will say:

Instead of:
> "Uh, which portfolio was that again?"
